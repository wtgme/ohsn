i am today. they don't care at all. they're cruel and dispicable. they made fun of me for crying when my bestfriend killed herself. people in my school have destroyed me. literally. @self_harm_adict well thank you very much for that, if only it was true.. it means alot though&lt;3 i compare myself to every girl i see.i lose, everytime.. #funfact my face will make you cry. i starve myself because if i'm thin then maybe i can be pretty. maybe i'll be loved then.. i hurt myself because it makes me feel alive. as if ruining my life wasn't enough, he just rubs it in. i can't believe he can just walk into my house after everything hes done.. i'm an emotional wreck. @_n0liife you're beautiful&lt;3 i literally hate how i look.. tbh, i just hate feeling this way.. i want to be okay again and i can't.. i want a body i can be confident in. christmas wishlist:thigh gap,hip bones,rib bones,concave stomach,thin arms,boney wrists,pronounced cheek bones,defined spine. i'm broken. i'm ugly.i'm a bitch.i'm fat.i'm stupid.i'm worthless.thats why i have each of these words carved into my skin. words hurt bitch. i have the scars to prove it. i express myself through dark thoughts and blood. you'll never understand the satisfaction of losing weight or carving your body like me. darling, how can you love me, if i can't even love myself? i hate myself. @ximjustbroken you're stunning! so beautiful! &lt;3 i'm just a fat, ugly, screw up. i deserve to die. i'm that replaceable friend, the one everyone has but no one really cares about.. if i died, no one would care. this is why i'm fucked up. they force me to eat and then yell at me to lose weight. not like i starve myself and then forcefully throw up what you make me eat. ugh. my parents are nagging me to lose weight. wow. my parents make fun of self harm way to often. then they look at me and laugh. i love how they don't care. ugh. rt @againstsuicide: rt if you've been affected by suicide in any way. i'm acting happy and confident in the hopes that one day, i truly will be happy and confident. my main account argues this point, i post a lot of selfies. why? because i'm trying to change who i am. i'm trying to be confident. i'm literally so ugly i avoid the mirror when i brush my teeth. people judge me by how i look, which is exactly why people think i'm happy. lol no. i'm not happy. i pretend to be to keep you happy. i'm no ones first choice.second choice.third choice.fourth.fifth.sixth.seventh.eighth.honestly, i'm not even anyones last choice. i honestly do care for everyone. i love you, because i know how it feels to not be loved, to be alone. i don't want you feeling how i feel. i'm the upbeat girl that always has a smile on her face, that can always be counted on to hold you while you cry, but i'll never be okay. when you start to see hip bones&gt; it just proves that i'm not loved by my so called "friends" thats why i keep to myself. usually that wouldn't seem bad, but i have never missed a day of school. i've had full attendance since primary.. this is actually so true for me.. i haven't been in school for how long and one person has asked where i am. http://t.co/eqvsgm8pn7 http://t.co/cfsu40oseo i act confident so people won't see how much i'm dying on the inside. so they won't see the hunger and the pain in my eyes, and on my body. i am.. http://t.co/reyvltcdjy i remember when life was easy. lol. what a sick illusion that was. when people notice scars&lt;&lt;&lt; #ana and #mia are who i am&lt;/3 not much beats cigarettes and mountain dew✌️ i only got this one

can always bounce back the next day!  hugs and love 😃😊 its never too late to change!! ill be having mini challenges throughout march that anyone can do, and they will be healthy! @lost_withscars 😍😍😍 its a new month so lets have a positive march! my goal this week is just to eat under a thousand calories, and burn off about 500 calories a day i decided like every two weeks ill be picking out two people, if they want it, and ill like send them a care package from the states in order to forgive, you have to remember how you were hurt in the first place. i should have known better than to trust a man you are likely to be killed while you’re lost in your mourning, because you let your guard down. we believe what we want to, what we need to. i'm the princess in an ivory tower, except every brick is made of history, and i built this prison myself as it turns out, you can love someone too much. then, when they leave, your heart goes missing. and no one can survive that great a loss. @caradelevingne is queen #model #love #inspiration once you had put the pieces back together, even though you might look intact, you were never quite the same as you’d been before the the worst thing about endings is knowing that just ahead is the daunting task of starting over the mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven. sometimes it’s not strangers that prey on us; it’s those we love who can do the most harm? #thinspo #thin15 #thinspiration http://t.co/zrx6savzmi #thinspo #thin15 #thinspiration http://t.co/bzqiufunue #thinspo #thin15 #thinspiration

http://t.co/nbgnpvumf3 if everyone else's opinion is what matters, then do you ever really have one of your own? truth is, sometimes things don’t happen to you for a reason. sometimes it’s just about being in the right place at the right time for others there are two reasons to not tell the truth; because lying will get you what you want, and because lying will keep someone from getting hurt rt @gxnefrxmhxme: waking up is the hardest part of the day people prefer to believe prettier, neatley wrapped lies sometimes life isn’t worth the pain. fat’ is usually the first insult a girl throws at
